## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of deep learning models specifically designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have greatly impacted the field of artificial intelligence. This repository is dedicated to providing an introduction to LLMs, covering topics such as:

- Architecture of LLMs
- Pre-training and fine-tuning techniques
- Popular LLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5
- Applications and use cases
- Limitations and ethical considerations

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the contents of this repository, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of:

- Python programming
- Machine learning concepts
- Deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
